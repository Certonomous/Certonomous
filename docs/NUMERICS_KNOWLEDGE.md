# Numericist knowledge base

Curated numerical knowledge for the Certonomous Numericist agent. Every entry
is evidence-backed from this repository's validated runs or the OpenFOAM
sources/guides in `docs/`. Foundational papers land in `docs/papers/` and get
distilled here.

## Validated facts (this repo's own evidence)

1. **Laminar cylinder drag benchmark** (2026-07-19/20, OpenFOAM v2606, WSL):
   generated O-grid + simpleFoam reproduces Tritton's experimental Cd —
   3.011 (Re 10), 2.161 (Re 20), 1.815 (Re 30), 1.618 (Re 40). Use as the
   regression anchor for any change to schemes, meshing, or solver settings.
2. **Grid convergence, same case**: 600 → 2400 → 9600 → 21600 cells gives
   Cd 2.191 → 2.161 → 2.156 → 2.158; ≈1.6% coarse-grid error, ≈0.2% beyond
   2400 cells. Second-order behavior consistent with `linearUpwind grad(U)`.
3. **Convergence ≠ physical validity**: at Re = 100 simpleFoam converges to
   residual 1e-7 on the *unstable symmetric branch* (Cd 1.181) while the real
   flow sheds (time-averaged Cd ≈ 1.3–1.4). A converged flag certifies the
   numerics only. Above Re ≈ 47, require the unsteady track (pimpleFoam) or
   report the regime caveat explicitly.
4. **Divergence-before-failure signature**: Re = 200 stalls at residual ~1e-3
   with Cd oscillation ~1e-2 at the iteration cap — a steady solver applied
   past its regime *degrades gracefully but measurably*. The LogMonitor's
   residual-spike heuristic (initial residual > 20× its running minimum after
   warm-up) is calibrated to catch the sharper failure mode.
5. **Scheme-dictionary completeness**: with `divSchemes default none;`, the
   laminar/turbulent stress term needs its explicit entry
   `div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U))))) Gauss linear;` — the string is constructed
   in `TurbulenceModels/.../IncompressibleTurbulenceModel.C` (divDevRhoReff).
6. **Runtime-compiled code is root-forbidden**: `#codeStream`/dynamicCode
   refuses to run as an administrator (`dynamicCode::checkSecurity`). All
   case execution runs as the dedicated `foam` user.
7. **motorBike STL benchmark** (2026-07-20, Head Engineer pipeline, serial):
   353,578-cell snappyHexMesh (291 s), simpleFoam 300 iterations (738 s) →
   Cd = 0.4167 ± 0.0013, Cl = 0.0641 ± 0.0011 (95% final-window envelopes).
   Mesh check reports max skew 8.94 (13 faces) at tutorial settings — known
   snappy behavior on this geometry; non-ortho max 65.0 is within scheme
   tolerance with 1 corrector. Log-banner caveat: every OpenFOAM log prints
   "Floating point exception trapping — enabled"; monitors must match the
   sigFpe *handler*, not the banner, or every run reads as fatal.

## Operating doctrine

- **Uncertainty is work-to-be-done** (lesson L-001): reduce with samples until
  irreducible; report envelopes, never bare values. Epistemic (sampling) and
  numerical (discretization) uncertainty are different channels — the GCI/
  mesh-refinement channel is the planned second axis.
- **Cost ledger discipline**: every recommendation states its compute price.
  Prefer the cheapest change that buys the most accuracy: scheme > grading >
  global refinement; reduced-order ensemble when the budget cannot fit the
  full sweep.
- **Tolerances**: production residualControl p 1e-5 / U 1e-6 (≈1000× tighter
  than tutorial defaults) because UQ treats converged values as evidence.
  float32-class cancellation risks apply to any quantity below ~1e-7 of its
  field scale.

## Foundational references — open access (verified 2026-07-20)

- **Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning** (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006) — GP
  regression returns a full Gaussian posterior: predictive mean *and* closed-form
  predictive variance at every test point, with kernel hyperparameters
  (signal variance, lengthscale, noise) set by maximizing the log marginal
  likelihood, which trades fit against complexity automatically. Source:
  http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/ (Ch. 2, 4, 5).
  *Applies*: the mathematical warrant for `uncertainty.py` treating GP posterior
  variance as epistemic uncertainty — variance grows away from sampled designs
  and shrinks where solves exist, which is precisely what drives our
  thin-direction flags and where the next run should go.
- **Survey of multifidelity methods in UQ, inference, and optimization**
  (Peherstorfer, Willcox & Gunzburger, SIAM Review 60(3), 2018) — combine many
  cheap low-fidelity evaluations with a few high-fidelity ones kept in the loop
  for accuracy guarantees; multifidelity Monte Carlo is an *unbiased*
  control-variate estimator whose optimal sample allocation and coefficients
  α_i = ρ_i σ_hi/σ_i follow analytically from a fixed budget. Source:
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10761.
  *Applies*: the blueprint for the ROM-ensemble branch — coarse-mesh/ROM
  evaluations are the low-fidelity model, fine OpenFOAM runs the high-fidelity
  one, and the measured correlation ρ between them decides both the allocation
  and whether multifidelity is worth using at all.
- **A survey of projection-based model reduction for parametric dynamical
  systems** (Benner, Gugercin & Willcox, SIAM Review 57(4), 2015) — build a
  reduced basis (POD / reduced-basis greedy / balanced truncation), pay a large
  offline cost for fast online evaluation; unlike data-fit surrogates,
  projection admits rigorous system-theoretic error bounds, and effectiveness
  is governed by singular-value decay. Source:
  https://kiwi.oden.utexas.edu/papers/Parametric-model-reduction-survey-Benner-Gugercin-Willcox.pdf.
  *Applies*: justifies the ROM ensemble's offline/online split; our sweep
  snapshots feed POD, singular-value decay is the admissibility diagnostic, and
  the ROM error bound must be carried alongside GP variance, not absorbed.
- **CFD Vision 2030 Study** (Slotnick et al., NASA/CR-2014-218178, 2014) — the
  2030 target capability explicitly "includes automated management of errors and
  uncertainties" and far higher workflow automation; Finding 4 names mesh
  generation/adaptivity as a persistent bottleneck with "inadequate error
  estimation capabilities," and Finding 5 calls for algorithms enabling error
  estimation, sensitivity analysis, and UQ. Source:
  https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20140003093.
  *Applies*: the strategic case for Certonomous — the field's own roadmap names
  automated meshing, automated error/uncertainty management, and embedded UQ,
  which map onto our mesh-quality gate, GP epistemic layer, and MC propagation.
- **OpenFOAM mesh-quality and solution controls** (ESI/Foundation user guides) —
  snappyHexMesh `meshQualityDict` defaults: `maxNonOrtho 65`,
  `maxInternalSkewness 4`, `maxBoundarySkewness 20`, `minTetQuality 1e-15`,
  relaxed `maxNonOrtho 75` during layer addition; `checkMesh` acceptance practice
  is max non-orthogonality < 70° (mean < 20°) and max skewness < 4. Steady
  `fvSolution` practice: relaxation p 0.3 / U 0.7, `nNonOrthogonalCorrectors` 0,
  and `residualControl` as the run-termination criterion — distinct from the
  per-iteration linear-solver `tolerance`/`relTol`. Sources:
  https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-meshing-snappyhexmesh-meshquality.html,
  https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/6-solving/6.3-solution-and-algorithm-control.
  *Applies*: the numeric thresholds for our mesh gate (flag > 70° non-ortho or
  > 4 skewness before solving — our motorBike mesh at 65.0°/8.94 sits in the
  warning band on skewness) and for admitting runs into the GP training set only
  when `residualControl` targets were actually met.
  **Note**: 65 is the *generation* constraint, 70 the *acceptance* threshold,
  75 the relaxed layer-addition value; gate on 70 and treat 65–70 as a warning.

- **Eça & Hoekstra (2014)** (J. Comput. Phys. 262:104–130) — least-squares fit

## Supplied papers — read 2026-07-20

These were the references previously listed as needed; they are now in
`docs/papers/` and have been read.

- **A procedure for the estimation of the numerical uncertainty of CFD
  calculations based on grid refinement studies** (Eça & Hoekstra, *J. Comput.
  Phys.* 262:104–130, 2014) — estimates the numerical uncertainty of any
  integral or local quantity by fitting **four types of power-series expansion
  in cell size to solutions on systematically refined grids in the
  least-squares sense**, selecting the best estimate by the standard deviation
  of the fits, and converting error into uncertainty with **a safety factor
  that depends on the observed order of convergence and on the scatter of the
  fit**. For well-behaved data — monotone convergence at the expected order,
  no scatter — it reduces to the Grid Convergence Index.
  *Applies*: this is the procedure our discretisation-uncertainty channel
  should implement, and it disqualifies what we do now. Our grid-sensitivity
  probe compares two meshes, which yields a *difference*, not an uncertainty.
  Eça–Hoekstra needs systematically refined grids (four or more to fit with
  scatter) and rewards us precisely in the case we keep hitting: noisy,
  non-monotone data where a bare GCI would mislead.

- **Overview of ASME V&V 20-2009** (Dowding, Sandia SAND2016-5342C, 2016) —
  the standard's procedure for combining **numerical, input-parameter, and
  experimental uncertainties into a single validation uncertainty** against
  which a model's error is judged.
  *Applies*: we currently report estimator uncertainty and physical spread and
  call the rest "unquantified". V&V 20 gives the shape of a defensible
  validation claim — and makes explicit that without an experimental
  comparison we cannot make one at all, which is why our aircraft results
  stop at TREND ONLY.

- **Verification and Validation in Scientific Computing** (Oberkampf & Roy,
  Cambridge University Press, 2010) — systematic development of verification
  (are we solving the equations right) versus validation (are we solving the
  right equations), and of the **aleatory/epistemic distinction**.
  *Applies*: confirms the vocabulary our uncertainty layer already uses — GP
  posterior variance is epistemic and reducible by sampling; the propagated
  freestream spread is aleatory and is not. It also names what we skip:
  *code* verification. We verify solutions, never the solver itself, and
  should say so rather than let "validated" imply more than it does.

- **Sparse and Deep Gaussian Processes closure for 2-D fluids and ocean
  flows** (Mouzahir & Lermusiaux, MIT, OSM26) — sparse variational and deep GP
  closures for under-resolved 2-D flow, targeting the truncation and
  discretisation error left by coarse resolution.
  *Applies*: the project owner's own line of work and the natural next closure
  for this lab. Our closure registry currently holds one empirical
  coarse-grid correction measured on a cylinder; this is the principled
  version — a learned closure with its own uncertainty — and it is what the
  Chief Researcher's approval protocol was built to gate.

- **Error quantification of Gaussian process regression for extracting
  Eulerian velocity fields from ocean drifters** (Xia, Iskandarani, Gonçalves
  & Özgökmen, *JMSE* 13:431, 2025) — evaluates GPR interpolation error and
  argues that **cross-validation alone does not capture spatial and temporal
  correlation structure**, so it understates true error.
  *Applies*: a direct critique of how we calibrate. Our leave-one-out
  inflation factor is a cross-validation estimate, and this paper says such
  estimates are optimistic when samples are correlated — which our design
  points are, being drawn along the same sweep. The honest reading is that our
  reported epistemic envelope is a floor, not a bound.

- **Solving functional PDEs with Gaussian processes** (Yang, Darcy, Hudes,
  Alexander, Eyink & Owhadi, arXiv:2512.20956, 2025) — GP *operator* learning
  on function space for functional renormalisation-group equations,
  discretisation-independent and able to carry physical priors in the mean or
  kernel.
  *Applies*: the direction beyond fitting one surrogate per metric — a GP that
  learns a mapping rather than a number, and that accepts physics in the prior.
  Relevant when our surrogates outgrow a quadratic response surface.

- **OpenFOAM for Francis turbine transients** (Salehi & Nilsson, *OpenFOAM
  Journal* 1, 2021, DOI 10.51560/ofj.v1.26) — establishes OpenFOAM as a
  trustworthy solver for turbine transient operation by validating against
  experiment on a high-head Francis turbine; studies mesh-diffusivity choice
  for Laplacian smoothing under domain deformation, and finds that **general
  slip boundary conditions cannot be used on the guide-vane upper and lower
  surfaces**.
  *Applies*: the model for how a claim of trustworthiness is earned — against
  experimental data, not against self-consistency. Its boundary-condition
  finding is the general warning our lab needs: a condition that is formally
  available is not therefore appropriate, and the failure is silent.

## What this changes in our practice

1. **Stop calling a two-mesh comparison an uncertainty.** Rename it what it
   is — a sensitivity difference — and implement Eça–Hoekstra properly:
   systematically refined grids, least-squares fit of power-series expansions,
   safety factor from the observed order and the fit scatter.
2. **Report the three uncertainty channels separately** (V&V 20): estimator
   (sampling), input-propagated (aleatory), and numerical (discretisation),
   and never merge them into one band.
3. **Say that we verify solutions, not code** (Oberkampf & Roy). Our VALIDATED
   tier means converged, in-regime, tight envelope — not code-verified.
4. **Treat the GP envelope as a floor, not a bound** (Xia et al.), because our
   leave-one-out calibration is cross-validation over correlated samples.
5. **No trust tier above TREND ONLY without an experimental comparison**
   (Salehi & Nilsson, V&V 20). Mesh quality and convergence justify a trend;
   only data justifies a magnitude.
6. **Add a boundary-condition sanity gate.** An available condition is not an
   appropriate one, and the failure mode is silent.
